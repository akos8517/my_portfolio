# Visual Analytics: Unicorn Analysis

This project was completed as part of my university coursework. It involved analyzing and visualizing data related to Unicorn companies.

## Project Description

The goal of the project was to explore and analyze a dataset of Unicorn companies, which are companies that recently achieved a valuation of over $1 billion. The dataset was obtained from Kaggle and contained information about the companies' characteristics and performance.

## Tasks and Analysis

The project involved three main tasks:

1. High-Dimensional Data Analysis:
   - Conducted analysis such as correlation matrix and t-SNE visualization.
   - Explored the relationships and patterns within the high-dimensional data.

2. Graph Data Analysis:
   - Analyzed the data using bar graphs to showcase the top countries with total raised funding.
   - Created a connectivity matrix to understand the relationships between countries.

3. Temporal Dynamics Analysis:
   - Analyzed the data using bar plots to identify the top countries with the highest number of Unicorn companies.
   - Created a heatmap to visualize the ranking of countries based on their Unicorn company presence.

## Visual Analytics System

As part of the project, I developed a simple webpage using HTML to showcase the visualizations and analysis. The webpage provided an interactive and user-friendly interface for exploring the insights derived from the data.

## Results and Evaluation

In the individual assignment, I received a grade of 15.25/20. The feedback highlighted that the analysis was average and provided areas for improvement.

For the group assignment, our team plotted a stream graph for the temporal dynamics dataset and received a grade of 28/40.

## Conclusion

Overall, this project allowed me to apply my data analysis and visualization skills to explore the Unicorn companies dataset. It provided valuable insights into the characteristics and trends of these high-growth companies.
